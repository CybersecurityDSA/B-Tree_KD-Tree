KD-TREE :-
------

A k-d tree, or k-dimensional tree, is a binary tree data structure used for efficient multidimensional search. It organizes points in a k-dimensional space, facilitating operations like nearest neighbor search and range search.

In a KD tree (K-dimensional tree), the primary parameters and properties include:

Dimensionality (K) :-
------------------

Represents the number of dimensions or attributes used to organize the data in the tree. Each node in the tree corresponds to a point in a K-dimensional space.

Splitting Axis :-
---------------

At each level of the tree, the data is partitioned along one of the K dimensions. This dimension is known as the splitting axis.

Splitting Value :-
---------------

The value along the splitting axis that divides the data into two subsets. Nodes to the left (or below) of this value belong to the left subtree, while nodes to the right (or above) belong to the right subtree.

Balanced Structure :-
-----------------------

Ideally, a KD tree is balanced, meaning that each subtree has roughly the same number of nodes. This ensures efficient searching and insertion operations.

Leaf Nodes :-
--------------

Terminal nodes in the tree that do not have any children. These nodes represent individual data points or clusters of points.

Traversal Order :-
------------------

KD trees are typically traversed depth-first, with recursive algorithms used for searching, insertion, and deletion. Traversal order can vary based on the splitting criteria and the specific operation being performed.

Nearest Neighbor Search :-
--------------------------

One of the key properties of KD trees is their ability to efficiently perform nearest neighbor searches in K-dimensional space. This operation involves finding the closest data point to a given query point.

Range Search :-
--------------

KD trees can also perform range searches efficiently, where all points within a certain distance (radius) of a query point are retrieved.

Space Partitioning :-
------------------------

KD trees partition the K-dimensional space into non-overlapping regions, with each node representing a region or a point within a region.

Optimization Techniques :-
-----------------------------

Various optimization techniques can be employed to improve the performance of KD trees, such as median splitting, balancing strategies, and pruning methods.

KD trees are widely used in applications such as spatial indexing, nearest neighbor search, and range search in multidimensional data sets, including computational geometry, machine learning, and computer graphics.
