Application for kd-tree :-
------------------------

Inserted 5,10 for the root and thus created the KD Tree . 

Time taken for creation of root node 5,10 is 0.00000001 nanoseconds

Inserted 2,3

Time taken for insert node 2,3 is 0.000001 nanoseconds

Inserted  8,12

Time taken to insert node 8,12 is 0.000001 nanoseconds

Inserted  7,6

Time taken to insert node 7,6 is 0.000001 nanoseconds

Deleted  8,12

Time taken for deletion of node 8,12 is 0.00000001 nanoseconds

Values to find nearest neighbour :5 10
Nearest Neighbour: 5,10
Time taken for finding nearest node to 5,10 is 0.000000 nanoseconds

Kd-tree Application traversal:

x:5 y:10
x:2 y:3
